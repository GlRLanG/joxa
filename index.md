News
----

Joxa is not yet ready for release. However, we should be releasing an
alpha in the next few days. In the mean time you can review the source
[here](https://github.com/erlware/joxa).


What is Joxa
------------

Joxa is a modern lisp in the style of Clojure designed to run on the
Erlang VM.

Joxa is *not* Erlang, nor Clojure, nor Common Lisp. It shares elements
of all these languages, and knowing these languages will help you get
up to speed with Joxa, but it is its own unique language.

Getting Started
---------------

You will probably want to start with
[Syntax](https://github.com/erlware/joxa/wiki/Syntax) the
[Joxa Language Specification](https://github.com/erlware/joxa/wiki/JoxaLanguageSpecification)
or the [FAQ](https://github.com/erlware/joxa/wiki/FAQ). If you want to
get started developing Joxa you may want to take a look at the
[Creating A Bootstrap](https://github.com/erlware/joxa/wiki/JoxaLanguageSpecification)
documentation.
